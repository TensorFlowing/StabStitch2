> ### Feature
> Compared with the conference version (StabStitch), the main contributions of StabStitch++ are as follows:
> 
> 1. We propose a differentiable bidirectional decomposition module to carry out bidirectional warping on a virtual middle plane, which evenly spreads warping burdens across both views. It benefits both image and video stitching, demonstrating universality and scalability.
>    
> 2. A new warp smoothing model is presented to simultaneously encourage content alignment, trajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Different from StabStitch that sacrifices alignment for stabilization, the new model makes no compromise and optimizes both of them in the online mode.
